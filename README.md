instructions to run:

cd into frontend
npm install lucide-react (may or may not be installed already, npm intall with the json file doesn't seem to get all the dependencies...)
different terminal: cd into backend
python manage.py runserver (should be running on host http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
ensure that the path running the backend aligns with the path saved in the front/src/components/backendPath.js file 
go to http://localhost:3000/ for site.
